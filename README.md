# stadium-attendance-prediction
Cross-validated Lasso regression for predicting attendance on football stadiums.

The idea behind this project is to build a **machine learning model** that would predict the number of attendees of polish ***Ekstraklasa*** (1st division) foootball matches as accurately as possible. It is important to mention, that unlike in *Bundesliga* or *Premier League*, polish stadiums are rarely completely filled. This in turn, creates the possibility to invstigate what lures people into buying tickets and what discourages them from doing so. This is an **end-to-end** project, that includes **data gathering** through web-scraping and external API, **data cleaning, transforming** and **modelling**. In result, a **cross-validated Lasso Regression** model has been developed.
